Jacks or better video poker is a derivative of 5-card draw. A player is initially dealt 5 cards from a standard 52-card deck. The player is then alloted one round to discard anywhere between 0 to 5 cards in their hand and draw the same number of new cards from the remaining cards in the deck. The resulting 5-card hand is the deciding factor in the player's received payout, if any. The lowest possible payout is 1-to-1, which results from a single pair of high cards (i.e. 2 Jacks, 2 Queens, 2 Kings, or 2 Aces).

9/6 jacks or better video poker is considered to be one of the best paying casino games available. 9/6 refers to the pay table that correlates to receiving a 9-to-1 payout for a full house and a 6-to-1 payout for a flush.

There is an article found on Wizard of Odds written by Michael Shackleford (https://wizardofodds.com/games/video-poker/strategy/jacks-or-better/9-6/simple/) that describes a simple strategy supposedly resulting in an expected return of 99.46%. This simple strategy is a subset of a much more complicated strategy developed by the same author (https://wizardofodds.com/games/video-poker/strategy/jacks-or-better/9-6/optimal/) that instead results in an expected return of 99.54%. The cost of using the simple strategy is 0.08%, but is much more feasible to use in a real-world environment. 

This demonstration seeks to test Shackleford's simple strategy by simulating the use of his algorithm over multiple iterations in accordance to the law of large numbers.

The pay table that is used in this simulation can be found on Casino News Daily (http://www.casinonewsdaily.com/video-poker-guide/pay-charts-video-poker/). Because the payout for a royal flush is disproportionately higher when betting 5 coins, the simulation will use the 5-coin pay scale.
